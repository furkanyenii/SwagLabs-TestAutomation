### Test Website : [SwagLabs](https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/ "SwagLabs")

#### Requirements : 

* First of all, if you want to work on this project, you need to have Java 11. In addition, Selenium, Testng and webdrivermanager libraries were used. 

#### In this project, what do we test?

* First of all, we have 3 different scenarios. But these scenarios may increase over time and new test cases may be added. 

##### Scenario 1: Successfully logging into the system with the username and password that SwagLabs has defined for us for testing purposes. 
##### Scenario 2: Login to the system with the correct user name and wrong password and check the error that the system gives. 
##### Scenario 3: Selecting a product from the Products page and adding the product to the shopping cart and completing the shopping process.
